# Determine whether a grapth is bipartite.

Project that required knowledge about graph stuctures and algorithms. The task was to read the structure of the graph from file, write its vertecies to the program memory and detemine if the graph is bipartite. 
Bipartition is the ability to divide the vertices of a graph into two groups, so that vertices connected by an edge do not belong to the same group. The recursive algorithm dfs was used to determine whether a graph is bipartite or not.
